    Hello, we are computer science students at the University of Tennessee. We're collecting data
    regarding the first language developers learn. Data we've collected via worldofcode suggests 
    that your first language was LANGUAGE. If this is correct we would appreciate it if you'd 
    reply with 'yes' to this email. If not, please reply 'no'. Thank you for participating!
    (Or just reading :-))
